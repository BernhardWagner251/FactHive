# Community-Driven News and Fact-Checking Platform

A decentralized news platform built on the Stacks blockchain that empowers communities to submit, verify, and fact-check news articles through a reputation-based system.

## 🌟 Features

- **Article Submission**: Community members can submit news articles with source verification
- **Credibility Voting**: Users vote on article credibility (credible, questionable, false)
- **Professional Fact-Checking**: Qualified users can submit detailed fact-check reports
- **Reputation System**: Merit-based system that rewards quality contributions
- **Community Moderation**: High-reputation users can moderate content and verify other users
- **Transparent Scoring**: Public credibility scores based on community consensus

## 🏗️ Architecture

This platform is built using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain, ensuring:
- **Immutable Records**: All articles, votes, and fact-checks are permanently recorded
- **Transparent Governance**: All actions are publicly verifiable on-chain
- **Decentralized Control**: No single entity controls the platform
- **Reputation Integrity**: User reputation cannot be artificially manipulated
